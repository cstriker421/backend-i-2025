```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd final_project
```

Build and run the containers:

```

(Optional) Create superuser:

```bash
make docker-superuser
```

## CLI Usage

Run the CLI inside the container:

```

Available commands:

```bash
make book-add          # Add a new book (Override vars: make book-add BOOK="..." AUTHOR="..." etc.)
make book-list         # List all books
make book-summary      # Show reading summary
make book-mark-read    # Mark a book as read (ID variable)
make book-log          # Log a reading session (ID, MINUTES, NOTES variables)
```

**User management (manual commands):**
```bash
docker compose run --rm web poetry run python -m cli.cli register
docker compose run --rm web poetry run python -m cli.cli login
docker compose run --rm web poetry run python -m cli.cli logout
```

## Testing

The project includes test coverage for Django views, models, forms, and URLs using `pytest`.

To run all Django tests:

```bash
make docker-test-django
```

To run locally without Docker:

```bash
make pytest-local
```

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CLI Tests Notice

CLI tests were attempted but removed due to PostgreSQL transactional testing limitations.  
Testing CLI commands inside the pytest environment with a persistent Postgres connection can cause errors and data inconsistency.

**However, all CLI commands were tested manually and function as intended.**

Optional manual test script can be used:
```bash
sh manual_cli_tests.sh
```
*(script provided in the repo)*
